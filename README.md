# Module3_API_Hypothesis
*Flatiron Module 3 Project on API data extraction and hypothesis testing*

**Members:** Michelle J. Kim, Ian Reinert

**Goals:** Test significance of factors that impact Data Scientist salaries. Tested factors include geography (proxy for cost of living), role title (proxy for experience), and company type (proxy for industry).

**Responsibilities:** Michelle wrote a salary data extraction pipeline, cleaned data, categorized role/geography, and performed initial visualizations for hypothesis testing assumptions. Ian researched and performed hypothesis testing, post-hoc tests, and non-parametric tests.
